Coverage Universe — defines which issuers get AI processing.

Configuration lives in data/reference_data/companies.yaml under `coverage_universe`:
  tiers: [core, major, additional, supply_chain]   # which tiers to include
  expanded_additions: [ABNB, ARM, ...]             # extra tickers from expanded tier

Used to filter expensive AI operations (speaker mapping, NLP signals, earnings insights)
to a realistic ~100-150 name universe instead of the full ~500 issuer market data set.
